    <h1>Dosa</h1>
    <img src="./dosa.jpg" alt="Dosa">
    <p>Dosa is a popular South Indian dish that resembles a thin, crispy crepe made from fermented rice and black lentils batter. 
        It has a delightful golden-brown exterior and a slightly tangy flavor due to the fermentation process.
        Dosas are incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed plain or with a variety of fillings, the most popular being the spiced potato filling, known as masala dosa. 
        Traditionally served with sambar and coconut chutney, dosa is a beloved breakfast item but is also enjoyed throughout the day as a snack or meal.</p>
